 Okay, so today I will give you a brief introduction to the course, okay, and we shall start with the other elections.
 Okay, so the requirements, lots, all the things that we have said about the requirements, okay, so for instance,
 all the requirements, all the stuff outside the software development fields.
 Okay, so for instance, here we have an issue in the Chinese slide that says,
 if you do not know, we have to go anywhere, we do, that seems reasonable, okay,
 but I do not have any specific target anywhere we do.
 Another more specific of program development of software development, is if you do not know what you want to achieve,
 whatever program you will develop, we will be fine.
 Okay, so the interesting point of these two statements is that they are true by themselves, okay,
 but essentially, they are nonsense, okay, why?
 Because we always add some good, especially when you build the software, you build software for a reason, okay,
 except the start and some space we want to know about the development software,
 just for the sake of this software itself, okay,
 you add also the vehicles you want to use the software for some objective,
 that typically is nothing to use at software, okay,
 also the first sentence is not totally correct, okay, because if you go decide to go for a walk,
 okay, even though you do not have a specific objective, anyway, you have some desires, okay,
 you want to walk for instance, in playing instead of climbing, okay,
 you want to walk in a place where maybe you can look at shopping windows, okay,
 maybe you want to go in a place where there is public transportation, so if you are tired,
 you can jump on a bus and go home by bus, okay, these are all requirements,
 very often requirements are not expressed explicitly,
 but that doesn't change the nature of requirements, they are there, okay,
 and in fact, it will be your work, your job, to get the user quiet,
 to extract these requirements from an environment,
 be able to take all the regulations, whatever is relevant to the file,
 therefore, okay, so what we will see now is that
 they are still on a bus, okay, so the definition of official definition of app depots,
 the still on a bus is online, we have an inorganine side,
 which if I do not remember where it is just an inorganic document,
 what it is, so there you can find that information on all the courses,
 including this one, okay, and one of the first information that you find in the old page is
 the link to the syllabus, so please have a look at the syllabus,
 because we have to know with sufficient precision at what the course is.
 Okay, this is an in fact the date of the course,
 where the pages for all the courses are the same, so you have an analysis,
 contain all my geography that I speak from the course and the designers, okay,
 the description of the course is a different set of slides, okay,
 and the scene of which is the official definition of structure
 and formatted as required by the editors, okay, so what that objective is of this course.
 The A is to provide students with the basic knowledge and either to perform requirements
 in junior year, or by the way the requirements in junior year,
 that means that there is a whole bunch of activities that form and the entire discipline,
 which is the dictated two requirements, okay, so we talk about requirements in junior year.
 Start in form requirements in the institution, also in our professional domains,
 and if they go this form, we try to domains.
 The institution means that you have to extract the knowledge about objectives,
 about the environment, about Australian third, so much so on.
 From people who work at a problem owner, okay, so going back to what we said before,
 we marked a lot of software for the single software.
 We killed software to solve the sum, okay, so you have to understand the problem,
 okay, the requirements are the description of what we asked to do in order to solve
